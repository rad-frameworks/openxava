    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">We have seen how to calculate
      amounts using the<i> @DefaultValueCalculato</i>r annotation on
      collections. We will now see how to implement totals using the <i>@Calculation</i>
      annotation.<br>

      <h3><a name="Lesson 5: Basic business logic-Calculated properties-Persistent properties with Calculation"></a>Persistent
        properties with <i>@Calculation</i></h3>
      <i> </i>Sometimes calculated properties are not the best option. Imagine
      that you have a calculated property in <em>Invoice</em>, let's say <em>discount</em>:<br>
      <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
        <pre><code class="java">// DON'T ADD TO YOUR CODE, IT'S JUST TO ILLUSTRATE
public BigDecimal getDiscount() {
    return getAmount().multiply(new BigDecimal("0.10"));
}
</code></pre> If you need to process all those invoices with an <i>discount</i>
        greater than 1000, you have to code something like the next code:<br>
        <pre><code class="java">// DON'T ADD TO YOUR CODE, IT'S JUST TO ILLUSTRATE
Query query = getManager().createQuery("from Invoice"); // No condition in query
for (Object o: query.getResultList()) { // Iterates over all objects
    Invoice i = (Invoice) o;
    if (i.getDiscount() // Queries every object
        .compareTo(new BigDecimal("1000")) &gt; 0) {
            i.doSomething();
    }
}
</code></pre> You cannot use a condition in the query to discriminate by <em>discount</em>,
        because <i>discount</i> is not in the database, it's only in the Java
        object, so you have to instantiate every object in order to ask by the <i>discount</i>.
        In some cases this way is a good option, but if you have a really huge
        amount of invoices, and only a few of them have the <i>discount</i>
        greater than 1000, then your process will be very inefficient. What
        alternative do we have?<br>
        Our alternative is to use the <em>@Calculation</em> annotation. <em>@Calculation</em>
        is an OpenXava annotation that allows to associate a simple calculation
        to a persistent property. You can define <em>discount</em> with <em>@Calculation</em>
        as shown the next code:<br>
        <pre><code class="java">// DON'T ADD TO YOUR CODE, IT'S JUST TO ILLUSTRATE
@ReadOnly
@Calculation("amount * 0.10")
BigDecimal discount;
</code></pre> This is a regular persistent property, that is with a
        corresponding column in the database, but it has a calculation defined
        with <i>@Calculation</i>. In this case the calculation is <i>amount *
          0.10</i>, so whenever the user changes <i>amount</i> in the user
        interface <i>discount</i> will be recalculated instantly. The
        recalculated value will be saved in the database when user clicks on <i>Save</i>,
        just like in any persistent property. We also have annotated <i>discount</i>
        with <i>@ReadOnly</i>, so it looks and behaves like a calculated
        property, although you can omit <i>@ReadOnly</i> so the user could
        modify the calculated value.</div>
      <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> The most useful thing of <em>@Calculation</em>
        properties is that you can use it in conditions, so that you can rewrite
        the above process as shown in the next code:<br>
        <pre><code class="java">// DON'T ADD TO YOUR CODE, IT'S JUST TO ILLUSTRATE
Query query = getManager().createQuery("from Invoice i where i.discount &gt; :discount"); // Condition allowed
query.setParameter("discount", new BigDecimal(1000));
for (Object o: query.getResultList()) { // Iterates only over selected objects
    Invoice i = (Invoice) o;
    i.doSomething();
}
</code></pre> In this way we put the weight of selecting the records on the
        database server, and not on the Java server. Moreover, the discounts are
        not recalculated each time, they are already calculated and saved.<br>
        This fact also has effect in the list mode, because the user cannot
        filter or order by calculated properties, but he can do so using
        persistent properties with <em>@Calculation</em>:<br>
        <img src="files/business-logic_en025.png" alt="business-logic_en025.png"
          title="business-logic_en025.png"><br>
        <em>@Calculation</em> is a good option when you need filtering and
        sorting, and a simple calculation is enough. A shortcoming of <i>@Calculation</i>
        properties is that their values are recalculated only when the user
        interact with the record and changes some value of the properties used
        in the calculation, therefore when you add a new <i>@Calculation</i>
        property to an entity with existing data you have to update the values
        of the new column in the table using SQL. On the other hand if you need
        a complex calculation, with loops or consulting other entities, you
        still need a calculated property with your Java logic in the getter. In
        this last case if you need to sort and filter in list mode for the
        calculated property an option is to have both, the calculated and the
        persistent property, and synchronize their values using JPA callback
        methods (we'll talk about callback methods in future lessons). </div>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <h3 id="toc4"><a name="Lesson 5: Basic business logic-Calculated properties-Total properties of a collection"></a>Total
        properties of a collection</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">We want to add amounts to <em>Order</em>
      and <em>Invoice</em> too. To calculate vat, base amount and total amount
      are indispensable. To do so you only need to add a few properties to <em>CommercialDocument</em>
      class. The next figure shows the user interface for these properties: </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> <img src="files/business-logic_en030.png"
        alt="business-logic_en030.png" title="business-logic_en030.png"><br>
      Add the next code to <i>CommercialDocument</i> entity:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">@Digits(integer=2, fraction=0) // To indicate its size
BigDecimal vatPercentage;
   
@ReadOnly
@Stereotype("MONEY")
@Calculation("sum(details.amount) * vatPercentage / 100")
BigDecimal vat;

@ReadOnly
@Stereotype("MONEY")
@Calculation("sum(details.amount) + vat")    
BigDecimal totalAmount;    
</code></pre></div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Note how we have chosen <i>@Calculation
        + @ReadOnly</i> persistent properties over calculated ones for <i>vat</i>
      and <i>totalAmount</i>, because the calculations are simple, and
      filtering and ordering for them is very useful. Also, you can see how in <i>@Calculation</i>
      you can use <i>sum(details.amount)</i> to refer to the sum of the column
      <i>amount</i> of the collection <i>details</i>, in this way we don't need
      to have a <i>baseAmount</i> property. On the other hand, <em>vatPercentage</em>
      is a conventional persistent property. In this case we use <em>@Digits</em>
      (an annotation from Bean Validation, the validation standard of Java) as
      an alternative to <em>@Column</em> to specify its size.</div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;"> Now that you have written the
      amount properties of <em>CommercialDocument</em>, you must modify the
      list of properties of the collection to show <a class="wiki_link" href="view_en.html#View-Collection%20customization-Total%20properties%20%28new%20in%20v4.3%29">the
        total properties</a> of the <em>CommercialDocument</em> (<em>Invoice</em>
      and <em>Order).</em> Let's see it:<br>
      <pre><code class="java">abstract public class CommercialDocument extends Identifiable {
 
    @ElementCollection
    @ListProperties(
        "product.number, product.description, quantity, pricePerUnit, " +
        "amount+[" + 
        	"commercialDocument.vatPercentage," +
        	"commercialDocument.vat," +
        	"commercialDocument.totalAmount" +
        "]" 
    )
    private Collection&lt;Detail&gt; details;
 
    ...
}
</code></pre>Total properties are regular properties of the entity (<i>CommercialDocument</i>
      in this case) that are placed in the user interface below the column of a
      collection. For that, in <i>@ListProperties</i> you use square brackets
      after the property to enumerate them, like <i>amount[commercialDocument.totalAmount]</i>.
      Moreover, if you want just the summation of the column you don't need a
      property for that, with a + after the property in <i>@ListProperties</i>
      is enough, like <i>amount+</i>. In our case we combine both things, + and
      total properties between [ ]. </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Now you can try your application.
      It would behave almost as in figure at the begin of this section. “Almost”
      because <i>vatPercentage</i> does not have a default value yet. We add it
      in the next section.<br>
      <h3 id="toc5"><a name="Lesson 5: Basic business logic-Calculated properties-Default value from a properties file"></a></h3>

    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <h2 id="toc14"><a name="Lesson 5: Basic business logic-Summary"></a>Summary</h2>
      In this lesson you have learned how to define persistent properties with
      specific calculations using the <i>@Calculation</i> annotation and we saw
      the usefulness of the <i>@Digits</i> annotation to define type and length
      of fields. We also defined total properties using persistent properties
      with the <i>@ReadOnly</i> +<i>@Calculation</i> annotations, and we saw
      how to use sum to override a specific property.</div>
